        I am a student at Carleton University completing a Bachelor's in Computer Science: Cybersecurity Stream and considering pursuing a minor in Math and Religion.
        I enjoy computer science for many reasons. One of the main reasons why I enjoy learning about computer science is learning about the mathematics behind programming
        such as the math behind recursion as well as data structures and algorithms. I also enjoy programming in general as I like problem solving and bringing ideas to life. 
        I have chosen cybersecurity as my specialized stream because I am interested in learning cyber defense as well as networking, and would love to be part of a team that 
        helps make the internet a safer and secure place. I am considering math as my first minor because I am fascinated with the symmetry and patterns it holds, and religion
        as my second minor because I like to learn about history. Overall I love to learn and am open to new ideas.
